**🩺 Pneumonia Diagnosis Using Deep Learning**
📍 Objective
To build a deep learning model that classifies chest X-ray images as either Pneumonia or Normal, using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in TensorFlow/Keras.

**🧠 Overview**
This project utilizes the publicly available Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset from Kaggle. It includes training, validation, and test images, and the model is built using CNN architecture to perform binary classification.

**🛠️ Tools & Libraries**
Language: Python 3

Framework: TensorFlow/Keras

Libraries: numpy, matplotlib, pandas, OpenCV

Model Architecture: ResNet, CNN with layers including Conv2D, MaxPooling, and Dense
