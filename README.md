🎯 Object Detection Task Using OpenCV and YOLO V5
📍 Objective
To implement basic object detection using OpenCV and pre-trained YOLO V5 Model.

🧠 Overview
This project demonstrates object detection by identifying and drawing bounding boxes around features such as human faces using YOLO. The implementation is lightweight and suitable for learning foundational computer vision techniques.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Language: Python

Library: OpenCV

Model: YOLO V5

IDE: Google Colab

📁 Key Files
Object Detection Task.ipynb – Implementation of object detection logic

haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml – Used for face detection (optional to include in repo)

✅ Key Features
Object detection using Haar Cascade Classifiers (e.g., face detection)

Image preprocessing and grayscale transformation

Bounding box drawing on detected features

Real-time detection support (can be extended to webcam)

Simple and beginner-friendly implementation with OpenCV

🚀 Future Improvements
Extend detection to multiple object types (eyes, smiles, etc.)
Implement object detection using YOLO or SSD for higher accuracy
