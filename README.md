# Computer Vision & AI ‚Äî Object Detection & Image Classification

## üìö Project Overview

This repository contains projects and experiments in computer vision and AI focused on:

- Object detection using YOLO v5 + OpenCV  
- Image classification (e.g., pneumonia vs. normal chest X-rays) using deep learning  
- Basic image processing techniques such as filtering, edge detection, thresholding

## üöÄ Key Features & Objectives

- Apply object detection to images/videos, detecting objects with bounding boxes (YOLO v5)  
- Classify medical images (chest X-rays) into pneumonia vs. normal categories  
- Experiment with low-level image processing (filtering, edge detection, thresholding) to understand how images are manipulated and features revealed  
- Evaluate model performance (accuracy, loss, sensitivity/specificity for classification tasks)
